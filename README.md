# WordPress Plugin Development

I learned some WordPress development in 2018 for work. This was before Guttenberg was released and the approach was more simplistic. I've looked into Gutenberg Block Development, and while I do know React there is a signficiant learning curve to creating Blocks in Gutenberg. I've realized that I need to develop a strong foundation in WordPress Development in order to be able to learn the modern way of doing things. This book has been added to my 2 do list.
